In January 2010, Palmer and colleagues released a paper in [Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5962/148.full) documenting the environmental consequences of mountaintop mining in central Appalachia.  In addition to much press coverage, a Senate hearing, and multiple meetings with natural resource leaders, Palmer was interviewed by Steve Colbert.
