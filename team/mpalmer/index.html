  <h4>About me</h4>
	<p>My research, teaching, and leadership is focused on the sustainability of natural systems and the development of solutions to difficult problems at the interface of humans and the environment.  
  With a background in hydrology and ecology, my early career focused on testing hypotheses derived from fundamental ecological theory in marine and stream ecosystems.  
  Given dramatic declines in the health of these, by the late 1990’s I began working closely with natural resource managers to better understand how my research could contribute to the conservation and restoration of running-water systems. 
  This ultimately led me in 2010 to propose creation of a <a href="www.sesync.org">National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC)</a> which now serves the broad community of social, natural, and computational scholars, policy makers, business leaders, and other stakeholders in co-developing solutions to difficult problems at the interface of humans and nature.  
  At SESYNC, I am leading efforts to: use novel approaches for accelerating progress by the highly heterogeneous, transdisciplinary teams we serve; advance the science of team science; and, enhance the computational and cyber skills of scholars.
  <p></p>
  Aside from my current work with the SESYNC community and my lab’s research, I remain very active in working with nonprofits to provide scientific input on the impact of coal mining on running-water systems in the Appalachians and in Alaska and, most recently how to restore mined lands and their streams.</p>

  </p><h4>Research Bio</h4>
	<p>Dr. Margaret Palmer is Director of the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center, an NSF and University of Maryland supported research center dedicated to creating synthetic, actionable science related to the structure, functioning, and sustainability of socio-environmental systems. 
  In addition, as a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland, she oversees a research group focused on watershed science and restoration ecology. Having worked on streams, wetlands, and estuaries for > 30 years and leading scientific projects at national and international levels, she has more than 150 scientific publications and multiple ongoing collaborative research grants. 
  She is past Director of the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, currently serves on the editorial boards of the journals Restoration Ecology and Science and most recently published the 2nd edition of The Foundations of Restoration Ecology. Dr. Palmer has been honored as a AAAS Fellow, an Aldo Leopold Leadership Fellow, a Lilly Fellow, a Distinguished Scholar Teacher, a University System of Maryland Board of Regent's Faculty Award of Excellence, and an elected fellow of the Society for Freshwater Science as well as the Ecological Society of America (ESA). 
  In 2016, she was awarded the ESA Sustainability Science Award.
